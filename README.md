# lingo
Go client library for the Linode API.

# WIP
This is under active development and should probably not be used in any way for the time being.

# Purpose
The primary purpose of this is integrating with my soon-to-be-written Linode provider for Terraform. It's also useful as general Go language bindings for the Linode API.

# Available API
APIs that have been fully built out
