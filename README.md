# lingo
Go client library for the Linode API.

# WIP
This project is under very active development and is definitely *NOT* safe for production use! It's probably safe to use in hobby projects if the API you need happens to be finished.

# Completed APIs
- Domain
- Image
- Linode Types
- Regions
- Volume

# Partial APIs
- Linode Instance
- NodeBalancer
- Disk

# TODO APIs
- Networking
- LongView
- StackScripts (?)
- Profile (?)
- Account (?)

# Next steps
Once I've finished building this client library out, I will be using it to power a Linode provider for Terraform. So keep an eye out for that!
